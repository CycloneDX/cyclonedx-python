              "content": "boolean.py\n==========\n\n\"boolean.py\" is a small library implementing a boolean algebra. It\ndefines two base elements, TRUE and FALSE, and a Symbol class that can\ntake on one of these two values. Calculations are done in terms of AND,\nOR and NOT - other compositions like XOR and NAND are not implemented\nbut can be emulated with AND or and NOT. Expressions are constructed\nfrom parsed strings or in Python.\n\nIt runs on Python 3.6+\nYou can use older version 3.x for Python 2.7+ support.\n\nhttps://github.com/bastikr/boolean.py\n\nBuild status: |Build Status|\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\n::\n\n    >>> import boolean\n    >>> algebra = boolean.BooleanAlgebra()\n    >>> expression1 = algebra.parse(u'apple and (oranges or banana) and not banana', simplify=False)\n    >>> expression1\n    AND(Symbol('apple'), OR(Symbol('oranges'), Symbol('banana')), NOT(Symbol('banana')))\n\n    >>> expression2 = algebra.parse('(oranges | banana) and not banana & apple', simplify=True)\n    >>> expression2\n    AND(Symbol('apple'), NOT(Symbol('banana')), Symbol('oranges'))\n\n    >>> expression1 == expression2\n    False\n    >>> expression1.simplify() == expression2\n    True\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nhttp://readthedocs.org/docs/booleanpy/en/latest/\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstallation via pip\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo install boolean.py, you need to have the following pieces of software\non your computer:\n\n-  Python 3.6+\n-  pip\n\nYou then only need to run the following command:\n\n``pip install boolean.py``\n\n\nInstallation via package managers\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThere are packages available for easy install on some operating systems.\nYou are welcome to help us package this tool for more distributions!\n\n-  boolean.py has been packaged as Arch Linux, Fedora, openSus,\n   nixpkgs, Guix, DragonFly and FreeBSD \n   `packages <https://repology.org/project/python:boolean.py/versions>`__ .\n\nIn particular:\n\n-  Arch Linux (AUR):\n   `python-boolean.py <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-boolean.py/>`__\n-  Fedora:\n   `python-boolean.py <https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/python-boolean.py>`__\n-  openSUSE:\n   `python-boolean.py <https://software.opensuse.org/package/python-boolean.py>`__\n\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nTest ``boolean.py`` with your current Python environment:\n\n``python setup.py test``\n\nTest with all of the supported Python environments using ``tox``:\n\n::\n\n    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt\n    tox\n\nIf ``tox`` throws ``InterpreterNotFound``, limit it to python\ninterpreters that are actually installed on your machine:\n\n::\n\n    tox -e py36\n\nAlternatively use pytest.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright (c) Sebastian Kraemer, basti.kr@gmail.com and others\nSPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-2-Clause\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/bastikr/boolean.py.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/bastikr/boolean.py\n",

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
